## Scoring Pattern for Bacterial Classification

Zoonoticus Database v1.0 isnâ€™t just about identifying bacterial risks â€“ it **scores** them!

Using a scoring pattern based on key traits like **Zoonotic Potential**, **Resistance**, **Mobile Elements**, and **Virulence**, each bacterium is assigned a risk score. The higher the score, the greater the risk.

### How It Works:
- **Zoonotic Potential**: A "Highly Zoonotic" classification automatically triggers a higher score (3 points) and is classified as **Potential Zoonotic Bacteria**.
- **Resistance**: Bacteria with resistance traits earn additional points (2 points for resistance).
- **Mobile Elements**: Presence of mobile elements adds 1 point.
- **Virulence**: Low virulence bacteria add a lesser weight (1 point).

### Final Classification:
Based on the accumulated score, bacteria are classified into risk categories such as:
- **Highly Dangerous-Zoonotic Bacteria**: High zoonotic risk, resistance, and mobile elements.
- **High-Risk Zoonotic Bacteria**: High zoonotic risk and resistance (without mobile elements).
- **Resistance Threat Bacteria**: Resistance with mobile elements, but no zoonotic risk.
- **Virulent Bacteria**: Low zoonotic risk and low resistance but still potentially virulent.
- **Low Risk Bacteria**: Minimal zoonotic, resistance, and virulence traits.

This innovative scoring system adds depth to classification, offering **data-driven insights** to help researchers quickly pinpoint high-risk zoonotic pathogens.
